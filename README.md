# Tourism-page

This page was made as a way to practice a <br/>
cleaner code in React, by using useContext, <br/>
file division and single responsibility <br/>
components as my first steps in the SOLID<br/>
principles.

In this page I included the use of <br/>
localstorage, getBoundingClientRect and <br/>
more in order to achieve a more dynamic <br/>
page.

Features of this project:

Accordion:
  - Enlarge one image while the others shrink.
  - Show/hide location info on select.

Carrousel:
  - Expected carrousel behaviour(Left,right, index buttons).
  - "Universal" code, meaning, I could reuse it <br/>
     with different contents type.

Language Button:
  -  UseContext + localstorage to get it to work <br/> 
     predictably on different pages.
